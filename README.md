# windows Keylogger C++17 

A Windows-based keylogger developed in C++17 is a program designed to monitor and record keystrokes on a system running Windows OS. Often employed in cybersecurity studies or for monitoring purposes, a keylogger captures keystrokes and can then relay these logs to a chosen destination, such as an email account or a Telegram bot. Some advanced implementations also include modules that detect cryptocurrency wallet information, making them capable of capturing wallet addresses or other sensitive data. While these tools can serve educational or monitoring purposes within legal and ethical boundaries, it is important to recognize the ethical and legal considerations involved. Misuse of such software for unauthorized access or theft is strictly prohibited and illegal in most regions.
